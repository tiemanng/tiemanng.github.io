I am a political scientist at the University of Klagenfurt and the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna. Before, I worked at the University of Greifswald (1999-2003), the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder (2003-06), and at the Mayx-Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (2006-07). I hold an MA from Philipps University Marburg (1999) and a PhD from the European University Viadrina (2005).

My substantive research focuses on behavioral politics: (the spatial theory of) elections, the emergence and consequences of electoral systems, geographical models of electoral returns, and, more recently, the determinants of welfare attitudes and welfare chauvinism. Focusing on the intersection of theory and methods, I subscribe to the EITM paradigm, have strong interests in social choice and game theory, and apply frequentist and Bayesian models to address imminent research questions.
